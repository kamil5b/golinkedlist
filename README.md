# golinkedlist
I created my own linked list using Go. Even though Go had their own library for linked list named 'list'

currently using linear linked list because its practical and easy to use. Soon, we'll add circular linked list

Suitable for learning data structure with Go Language, its totally open source you just have to clone or download it
